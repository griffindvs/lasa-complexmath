# lasa-complexmath

This is a C++ library built to handle mathematical operations and functions for complex numbers. It was created as a project for an [Advanced Computer Programming course](http://lasacs.com).

To run the Driver.cpp file, use the command `g++ src\Driver.cpp -o Driver.exe`. This will create an executable for the Driver program. To run the file, type `Driver` into the terminal. This process works for any C++ file with a main method.
